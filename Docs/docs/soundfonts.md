## Loading the SoundFonts in the Demo Songs
	
To load the SoundFonts in the demo songs:

1. Locate a channel using one of the missing SoundFont. SoundFont channels have a **A&#8203;_A_** icon. 
	* On desktop, click on the channel name to show its settings in the Project Explorer.
	* On Mobile, double-tap on the channel name and the Project Explorer will appear.
2. In the Project Explorer, in the SoundFont generator settings, look for a red warning sign next to the SoundFont name and click it. 
3. Locate the reqested SoundFont somewhere on your device.

Once you fix one channel, it will fix all the other channels using this SoundFont. Also, once you tell KiraStudio where a SoundFont is located, it will remember it forever and not ask you again.
